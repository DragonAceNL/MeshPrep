# MeshPrep
A headless, scriptable toolset that combines Blender (headless), trimesh, and PyMeshFix to automatically repair, validate, and export print‑ready STL files in batch. Designed for deterministic pipelines, repeatable filter chains, and easy experimentation with repair strategies so no manual step is required before slicing.
